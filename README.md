Scripts and data accompanying the manuscript "Differences in the regulatory strategies of marine oligotrophs and copiotrophs reflect differences in motility"

The Data folder contains the biochemical model (file: Model10_SN.xslx) and experimental results used to make the figures. Note: to generate figure 1 (COG category differences between oligotrophs and copiotrophs), you will also need to download the file EGGO.csv from the Weissman et al. 2021 paper (https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/eggo/tree/master/Data). The Figures folder contains the accompanying figures. Scripts folder contains R scripts used to produce the figures.
